# **Introduction and context**
# project2_Henry_DataAnalytics
I've been tasked with analyzing the telecommunications sector at a national level, primarily focusing on the company's internet services. Understanding the broader behavior of communication services is crucial to guide the company in delivering quality, identifying growth opportunities, and providing personalized solutions to clients.




Welcome to the first individual project of the labs stage of the Henry Bootcamp! In this occasion, I am going to perform as an MLOps Engineer.  

I was tasked with developing an API using the **FastAPI** framework to make the company's movie datasets available. I was asked to create a minimum viable product ***(MVP)*** that included 6 functions for the API endpoints and another function for a recommendation system using machine learning.
